# Modern CSS Solutions for Old CSS Problems

## A series by [Stephanie Eckles](https://thinkdobecreate.com/)

Right now, it's essentially using DEV as a headless CMS to feed posts directly. But I'd love to expand it to additional resources, so stay tuned!

### Tech & Stats

- [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) - a static site generator capable of using Node modules and mixing template languages which was perfect for this type of project. It's also wickedly speedy!
- [html-css-jumpstart](https://5t3ph.github.io/html-sass-jumpstart/) - I expanded the minimal Sass/HTML starter that I recently released
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - hosting
- [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) - watches RSS feed to ping Netlify webhook to republish site when new DEV post published
- one single teensy JS function for a bit of delight on the main page
- 3.4kb CSS, Gzipped
- [Speed index](https://www.webpagetest.org/result/200815_36_7dc8a6b9634c6fd4f76d5ef79ce0a818/) - 0.803s
- Lighthouse score - ðŸ’¯
