Using a combination of the following properties, we can create custom, cross-browser, theme-able, scalable radio buttons in pure CSS:

- `currentColor` for theme-ability
- `em` units for relative sizing
- `radial-gradient` vs. `:before` for the `:checked` indicator
- CSS grid layout to align the input and label

> Head's up: A lot of these styles overlap with the episode on [custom checkbox styles](https://moderncss.dev/pure-css-custom-checkbox-style) which you might be interested in reading next!

## Radio Button HTML

There are two appropriate ways to layout radio buttons in HTML.

The first wraps the `input` within the `label`. This implicitly associates the label with the input that its labeling, and also increases the hit area to select the radio.

```html
<label>
  <input type="radio" name="radio" />
  Radio label text
</label>
```

The second is to have the `input` and `label` be siblings and use the `for` attribute set to the value of the radio's `id` to create the association.

```html
<input type="radio" name="radio" id="radio1" /> <label for="radio1">Radio label text</label>
```

Our technique will work with either setup, although we're going to select the wrapping label method to prevent including an extra div.

The base HTML for our demo including classes and two radios - necessary to test `:checked` vs. un-checked states - is the following:

```html
<label class="radio">
  <span class="radio__input">
    <input type="radio" name="radio" />
    <span class="radio__control"></span>
  </span>
  <span class="radio__label">Radio 1</span>
</label>

<label class="radio">
  <span class="radio__input">
    <input type="radio" name="radio" />
    <span class="radio__control"></span>
  </span>
  <span class="radio__label">Radio 2</span>
</label>
```

For groups of radio buttons, it is also necessary to provide the same `name` attribute.

Here's how the native HTML elements in Chrome appear:

## Common Issues with Native Radio Buttons

The primary issue that causes developers to seek a custom styling solution for radio buttons is the variance in their appearance between browsers which is increased when including mobile browsers as well.

As an example, here are radio buttons as shown on Mac versions of Firefox (left), Chrome (middle), and Safari (right):

![radio buttons in Firefox, Chrome, Safari](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/bnce8hn7xmnc9fibmspf.png)

The second issue is the inability of native radio buttons to scale with font-size alone. Here's this failure demonstrated again in those browsers, same order:

![radio buttons in Firefox, Chrome, Safari with no text scaling](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/5e1177oan4g1yqomcwev.png)

Our solution will accomplish the following goals:

- scale with the `font-size` provided to the `label`
- gain the same color as provided to the label for ease of theme-ability
- achieve a consistent, cross-browser design style, including `:focus` state
- maintain keyboard accessibility

## Theme Variable and `box-sizing` Reset

There are two base CSS rules that must be placed first in our cascade.

First, we create a custom variable called `--color` which we will use as a simple way to easily theme our radio buttons.

```scss
:root {
  --color: rebeccapurple;
}
```

Next, we use the universal selector to reset the `box-sizing` method used to `border-box`. This means that padding and border will be included in the calculation of any elements computed final size instead of increasing the computed size beyond any set dimensions.

```scss
*,
*:before,
*:after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

## Label Styles

Our label uses the class of `.radio`. The base styles we'll include here are the `font-size` and `color`. Recall from earlier that the `font-size` will not yet have an effect on the visual size of the radio `input`.

```scss
.radio {
  font-size: 2.25rem;
  color: var(--color);
}
```

We're using an abnormally large `font-size` just to emphasize the visual changes for purposes of the tutorial demo.

Our label is also the layout container for our design, and we're going to set it up to use CSS grid layout to take advantage of `grid-gap`.

```scss
.radio {
  // ...existing styles

  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: min-content auto;
  grid-gap: 0.5em;
}
```

Here's our progress as captured in Chrome, with Inspector revealing grid lines:

## Custom Radio Button Style

Ok, this is the part you came here for!

To prepare for this, we have wrapped our `input` in `span` with the class `radio__input`. Then, we have also added a `span` as a sibling of the `input` with the class `radio__control`.

Order here matters, as we'll see when we style for `:checked` and `:focus`.

{% newsletterPromo %}

### Step 1: Hide the Native Radio Input

We need to hide the native radio input, but keep it technically accessible to enable proper keyboard interaction and also to maintain access to the `:focus` state.

To accomplish this, we'll use `opacity` to visually hide it, and set its `width` and `height` to `0` to reduce its impact on the flow of elements.

```scss
.radio__input {
  input {
    opacity: 0;
    width: 0;
    height: 0;
  }
}
```

You may have seen more verbose solutions in the past, but we'll see why this works when we add the custom-styled control.

### Step 2: Custom Unchecked Radio Styles

For our custom radio, we'll attach styles to the span of class `radio__control` that is the sibling following the input.

We'll define it as block element that is sized using `em` to keep it relative to the `font-size` applied to the label. We also use `em` for the `border-width` value to maintain the relative appearance. Good ole `border-radius: 50%` finishes the expected appearance by rendering the element as a circle.

```scss
.radio__control {
  display: block;
  width: 1em;
  height: 1em;
  border-radius: 50%;
  border: 0.1em solid currentColor;
}
```

Here's our progress after hiding the native input and defining these base styles for the custom radio control:

![progress of styles for the custom radio control shows the custom control rendering lower than the radio label](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/otrqqovksrzojelvxgjk.png)

Uh - what is happening with that alignment?

Despite defining a `width` and `height` of `0`, with default behavior of the span it is still being calculated as an element with dimensions.

The quick fix for this is to add `display: flex` to the `.radio__input` span that wraps the native input and the custom control:

```scss
.radio__input {
  display: flex;
}
```

Flex honors the `0` dimensions, and the custom control pops up and acts like the only element within `.radio__input`.

![result of adding display: flex to fix the alignment](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/twgrzvkgfo777djrw4ej.png)

### Step 3: Improve Input vs. Label Alignment

If you've worked with grid or flexbox, your instinct right now might be to apply `align-items: center` to optically tune the alignment of the input in relation to the label text.

But what if the label is long enough to become broken across multiple lines? In that case, alignment along horizontal center may be undesirable.

Instead, let's make adjustments so the input stays horizontally centered in relation to the first line of the label text.

Our first step is to adjust the `line-height` on the span of class `.radio__label`.

```scss
.radio__label {
  line-height: 1;
}
```

Using the value of `1` is admittedly a quick fix here and may not be desirable if your application has multi-line radio labels more often than not.

Depending on font in use, that may not 100% solve the alignment, in which case you may benefit from the following additional adjustment.

On our custom control, we'll use `transform` to nudge the element up. This is a bit of a magic number, but as a starting point this value is half the size of the applied border.

```scss
.radio__control {
  // ...existing styles

  transform: translateY(-0.05em);
}
```

And with that our alignment is complete and functional for both single-line and multi-line labels:

![final alignment of input vs. label text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/b7iq4uuzptpkj2nvm10u.png)

### Step 4: The `:checked` State

Our use of `opacity: 0` has kept the native radio input accessible for keyboard interaction as well as click/tap interaction.

It has also maintained the ability to detect its `:checked` state with CSS.

Remember how I mentioned order matters? Thanks to our custom control _following_ the native input, we can use the adjacent sibling combination - `+` - to style our custom control when the native control is `:checked` ðŸ™Œ

#### Option 1: Creating the circle with `radial-gradient`

We can add a `radial-gradient` for a classic filled circle appearance:

```scss
.radio__input {
  // ...existing styles

  input {
    // ...existing styles

    &:checked + .radio__control {
      background: radial-gradient(currentcolor 50%, rgba(255, 0, 0, 0) 51%);
    }
  }
}
```

You can adjust the stop point for the gradient to your preference.

> Note the use of `rgba` to define a transparent color instead of the keyword `transparent` due to an issue with using `transparent` in gradients for Safari where its interpreted as "transparent black" ðŸ‘Ž

Here's a gif of the result:

![demo of the custom radio checked state with radial-gradient](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/4ascgip1sn3z03viaegl.gif)

> Since the `radial-gradient` is applied as a `background`, it will not be visible if the form page is printed with default printer settings which remove CSS backgrounds.

#### Option 2: Creating the circle with `:before`

The alternate method is to use `:before` on the custom control to become child element that renders as a circle.

The advantage of this method is that it is also available to animate.

We first need to change the behavior of the `.radio__control` wrapping span:

```scss
.radio__control {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
```

This is the quickest way to align the `:before` to the horizontal and vertical center of custom control.

Then, we create the `:before` element, including a transition and using transform hide it with `scale(0)`:

```scss
input + .radio__control::before {
  content: "";
  width: 0.5em;
  height: 0.5em;
  box-shadow: inset 0.5em 0.5em currentColor;
  border-radius: 50%;
  transition: 180ms transform ease-in-out;
  transform: scale(0);
}
```

Use of `box-shadow` instead of `background-color` will enable the state of the radio to be visible when printed (h/t [Alvaro Montoro](https://dev.to/alvaromontoro/comment/1214h)).

Finally, when the `input` is `:checked`, we make it visible with `scale(1)` with a nicely animated result thanks to the `transition`:

```scss
input:checked + .radio__control::before {
  transform: scale(1);
}
```

And here's a gif of the result using an animated `:before` element:

![demo of the custom radio checked state with :before](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/gsf9kzyremep24pssk0c.gif)

### Step 5: The `:focus` State

For the `:focus` state, we're going to use a double `box-shadow` in order to leverage `currentColor` but ensure distinction between the base custom radio button and the `:focus` style.

Again, we'll use the adjacent sibling combinator:

```scss
.radio__input {
  // ...existing styles

  input {
    // ...existing styles

    &:focus + .radio__control {
      box-shadow: 0 0 0 0.05em #fff, 0 0 0.15em 0.1em currentColor;
    }
  }
}
```

The order of `box-shadow` definitions corresponds with their layering, with the first definition being equal to the "top" layer. That means in this rule, we are first creating the appareance of a thin white border, which appears above a feathered out shadow that takes on the value from `currentColor`.

Here's a gif to demo the `:focus` appearance:

![demo of the custom radio focused state](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/t9vgfzfctn9rfcs6012t.gif)

And with that, the essential styles for a custom radio button are complete! ðŸŽ‰

## Experimental: Using `:focus-within` to Style the Label Text

Since the label is not a sibling of the native input, we can't use the `:focus` state of the input to style it.

An upcoming pseudo selector is `:focus-within`, and one feature is that it can apply styles to elements that contain an element which has received focus.

> The ModernCSS episode on a [pure CSS accessible dropdown navigation menu](https://moderncss.dev/css-only-accessible-dropdown-navigation-menu/) also covered `:focus-within`.

For now, `:focus-within` requires a [polyfill](https://allyjs.io/api/style/focus-within.html), so the following styles should be considered an enhancement and not relied on as the only way to provide a visual indication of focus.

The first adjustment we'll make is to add a `transition` and reduce the `opacity` of the `radio__label`:

```scss
.radio__label {
  // ...existing styles
  transition: 180ms all ease-in-out;
  opacity: 0.8;
}
```

_Ensure that the reduced opacity still meets appropriate contrast for your color palette._

Then, we'll test for focus by adding a rule for `:focus-within` on the label (`.radio`). This means when the native input - which is a child and therefore "within" the label - receives focus, we can style _any_ element within the label while focus is active.

So, we'll slightly bump up the visual size of the label text using `scale()`, and bring the opacity back up.

```scss
.radio {
  // ...existing styles

  &:focus-within {
    .radio__label {
      transform: scale(1.05);
      opacity: 1;
    }
  }
}
```

Use of `scale()` prevents the resize from impacting the flow of elements and causing any jittering. The transition makes this nice and smooth, as seen in this gif:
